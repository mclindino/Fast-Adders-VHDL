                                                                                Welcome to Cadence Encounter(R) RTL Compiler

Here is a quick introduction on how to access our product information.  
If you do not want this message to appear in the future, create an 
initialization file (an empty file will do) in your home directory 
called '~/.cadence/.synth_init'.

  To access the product documentation in HTML and PDF, type 'cdnshelp'
    at the system prompt. 
  For a list of available commands, type 'help'. 
  To view a man page for a command, type 'man <commandName>'.
  To view a man page for an error message, type 'man <messageID>'.
  For a list of all possible object types, type 'get_attribute -help'.
  For a list of all available attributes by object type, type
    'get_attribute * <object_type> -help'.
  For a list of all attributes for every object type, type
    'get_attribute * * -help'
  To list only writable attributes, substitute 'get_attribute' with
    'set_attribute'.
  To get a template script to run RTL Compiler, use the 'write_template'
    command.
  To get a template script to run Conformal based on the current RTL
    Compiler session, use the 'write_do_lec' command.
  
  Obsolete attributes in the current tool version.
  To learn more, type 'get_attribute -help <attribute> <object>'.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.
